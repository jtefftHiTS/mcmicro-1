## Comparison of Multiplex Imaging Technologies
To our knowledge, no systematic comparison of tissue imaging technologies has yet been published. There are four relevant performance metrics to compare: 
>1. the multiplicity or 'plex' of the assay  
>2. spatial resolution  
>3. spatial scale and statistical power, and   
>4. sensitivity or signal to noise ratio (SNR).

These parameters are not independent of each other - objective lenses with higher resolving power (higher numerical aperture) gather light more efficiently, therefore, are more sensitive, but with a smaller field of view.

### Multiplicity
Most discussion of the tissue imaging focuses on the multiplicity – the number channels – with a maximum number of 60 to 100 channels being typical. The great majority of published high-plex tissue imaging methods; however, involve 20-40 marker proteins. Increasing multiplicity is important, but most existing methods are limited by the specificity of antibody-antigen detection.

### Spatial resolution
Most microscopy advances over the past two decades focused on increasing spatial resolution (e.g. super resolution imaging by structure illumination [(Wu et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-018-0211-z){:target="_blank"} or stochastic reconstruction8), but resolution has not been thoroughly discussed in tissue imaging studies. Higher resolution improves signal-to-noise, makes segmentation more robust, and is essential for discerning small structures. Most slide-scanning microscopes use objectives the range of 0.4 to 1.0 NA, giving them lateral resolutions of ~600 to 250 nm at an illumination wavelength of 550 nm (see [MicroscopyU](https://www.microscopyu.com/microscopy-basics/resolution){:target="_blank"} for details). This resolution is good but could be rapidly improved if slide scanning microscopes adopted more state-of-the-art imaging methods.

### Spatial scale and statistical power
The size of samples being imaged is also critical for generating robust conclusions from tissue imaging data. Images exhibit spatial correlation on length scales up to 500 micron, so imaging insufficient sample areas may not provide an accurate representation – for many purposes, specimens at least one square centimeter are essential [(Lin et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.31.437984){:target="_blank"}. Additionally, it is increasingly clear that tissue microarrays (TMAs) are generally inadequate, despite their widespread use for increasing sample numbers. Clinically, TMAs are not used for diagnosis, and the FDA requires that digital histology be based on whole-slide imaging (WSI) [(FDA guidance document: FDA-2015-D-0230)](http://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/technical-performance-assessment-digital-pathology-whole-slide-imaging-devices){:target="_blank"}.

*MCMICRO was developed with the demands of high-plex, whole-slide imaging in mind.*
           
### Sensitivity
The sensitivity of an imaging method depends on a range of factors including the selectivity of the reagents, the quality of the instrumentation, resolution, etc. As such, sensitivity must be evaluated with respect to objective criteria. As mentioned above, the field awaits a rigorous comparison of different tissue imaging platforms (and of identical imaging platforms across multiple laboratories) before we can make robust comparisons of platform sensitivity.
