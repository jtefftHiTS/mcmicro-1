Minerva is a suite of software tools that enables interactive viewing and sharing of large image data [(Rashid et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41551-021-00789-8){:target="_blank"} and [(Hoffer et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.02579). 

Currently, we have released **Minerva Author**, a tool that lets you easily create and annotate images, and **Minerva Story**, a narrative image viewer for web hosting. 

**Additional tools are in active development - go to the [Minerva wiki](https://github.com/labsyspharm/minerva-story/wiki){:target="_blank"} for the most up-to-date information about the Minerva suite. **
