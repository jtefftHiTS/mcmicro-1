# CyLinter
## Quality Control

We recently developed CyLinter, a human-in-the-loop interactive quality control [software](https://github.com/labsyspharm/cylinter){:target="_blank"} for identifying and removing cells corrupted by microscopy artifacts in multiplexed tissue images. The program takes single-cell feature tables generated by the MCMICRO image processing pipeline as input and returns a set of de-noised feature tables for use in downstream analyses. 

Visit the [CyLinter website](https://labsyspharm.github.io/cylinter/){:target="_blank"} for detailed information about how to implement Cylinter.
