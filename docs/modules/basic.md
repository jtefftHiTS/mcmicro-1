# BaSiC

BaSiC is an illumination correction program that generally works well with default parameters.

BaSiC was developed externally by [(Peng et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms14836){:target="_blank"} - we recommend referring to the manuscript for more detailed parameter tuning information. 

The BaSiC software is found on [GitHub](https://github.com/labsyspharm/basic-illumination){:target="_blank"} with an accompanying [ReadMe](https://github.com/labsyspharm/basic-illumination#running-as-a-docker-container){:target="_blank"}.
